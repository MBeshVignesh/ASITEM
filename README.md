3D models are more accurate and leave very little or nothing to the imagination. so, we developed a deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Virtual Geometry
Group (VGG) network models to transform architectural sketches into precise 3D models and validated, lowering modeling costs by 70% compared to standard traditional methods by automating the design process.
